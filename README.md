    <ul> <li> Enigma Machine Coursework
      <ul> <li> <p> Description: To construct a virtual representation of the Enigma Machine by simulating key components such as Rotors, Reflectors, Plugs and the Plugboard which enables encrypting and decrypting a message. Furthermore, a bombe is also built as a test harness for the Enigma Machine. </p> <li>
        <li> <p> Extension: As an extension, I created a command line interface that allow a user to type a message a key at a time and have a translation of the key appear in the command line, which also allow the user to specify the plugs in the machine and the type and initial positions of the rotors. Facility to convert the input file into appropriate text for encoding/decoding is also being implemented which involve removing any whitespace, capitalising all letters in the file and removing any characters that canâ€™t be encoding including punctuation. </p> </li></ul>
